 Objective 1: How does the perceived safety of AVs compare to human-driven vehicles?
Use: SafeAv, SafeHuman

Tasks:

Compare average safety scores.

Use violin/box plots for visual distribution.

Segment by age groups or familiarity with tech/news.

ðŸ“Š Objective 2: What factors influence whether respondents believe AVs will have a positive or negative impact?
Use: AvImpact, FamiliarityTech, FamiliarityNews, Age, BikePghMember

Tasks:

Bar plots or heatmaps showing AV impact vs familiarity levels.

Analyze correlations or trends in perceptions.

ðŸš¦ Objective 3: Are people supportive of AVs operating in specific contexts like school zones or low-speed areas?
Use: SchoolZoneManual, Speed25Mph, TwoEmployeesAv

Tasks:

Calculate proportion of support vs opposition.

Explore demographic differences (e.g., age or car ownership).

ðŸš² Objective 4: Does being a cyclist, pedestrian, or member of BikePGH affect attitudes towards AV safety and data sharing?
Use: SharedCyclist, SharedPedestrian, BikePghMember, ShareTripData, SharePerformanceData

Tasks:

Cross-tabulations of attitudes toward AVs and AV data sharing.

Visuals like stacked bar charts.

ðŸ“± Objective 5: How do personal characteristics (like car ownership, smartphone use, age) correlate with openness to AV tech and incident reporting?
Use: AutoOwner, SmartphoneOwner, ReportSafetyIncident, Age

Tasks:

Explore demographics of people likely to report safety incidents.

Create age vs openness heatmaps or categorical plot
